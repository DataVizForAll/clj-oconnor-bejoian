          <h2>What is this about?</h2>
          <p> Connecticut school districts use their funding for school resources, such as, smaller class sizes, competitive teacher compensation, and other additional supports. When used wisely, school districts are more likely to have higher test scores, increased graduation rates, and other improved indicators of student achievements. In other words, the more money given spent on an individual student in the school district, the better educated the students will be. With the 169 towns in Connecticut, there is a large disparity between race and wealth due to preexisting discriminatory policies and prejudicial practices. Focusing on the 33 towns in the Hartford area, we wanted to take a closer look, seeing if there was a correlation between the enrollment rates by students’ race and ethnicity as well as how the district-level per-student spending vary by students’ race and ethnicity.

          <p>To visualize our first question, asking how enrollment rates by school type vary by student race & ethnicity, refer to <a href='https://www.datawrapper.de/_/mikwh/'>Chart 1</a>. We decided on combining the school types (Technical Education and Career, Program, Shelf Magnet, Public, Open, Public Charter, and College Affiliated) in each town to help focus on the ethnic and racial divide between the towns. To best visualize this data, we chose a stacked bar chart with White ethnicity in descending order. For visual purposes, Additional Combined and Hispanic/Latino are moved to the middle. Some cautions to be aware of when viewing Chart 1 are the grouping of the schools, and “Additional Combined” ethnicity. As stated before, the schools are combined to focus on the racial and ethnic divide between the towns, however, regional schools and other magnet schools are not included in this list due to some towns not having them or the school population being too low. American or Alaskan Native, pacific islander, and 2 or more races are classified as Additional Combined due to the limited data on the students.</p>

          <h2>Funding Breakdown by School Districts</h2>
          <p>For <a href='https://www.datawrapper.de/_/BHua9/'>Chart 2</a>, we will be using DataWrapper compiled by NCEP. The NCEP application provides the latest net current expenditures (NCE), average daily membership (ADM), net current expenditures per pupil (NCEP) and the Special Education Excess Cost grant basic contributions. We decided to use a choropleth map to highlight the current expenditure by each town in the Hartford Area. On top of that, we also included the percentage of White and BIPOC students in each town. To summarize the totals of each town, there were five towns in which the NECP was below $17.8k. Moreover, out of those five, three of them were under $17k with $16.2k, $16.2k, and $16.4k respectively. There were 16 towns that fell in the $17.8–$19.5k category. There were seven towns that fell in the $19.5k–$21.2k category. Interestingly, there were no towns in the range of $21.2k–$22.9k, and the NCEP jumped from the $19.5k–$21.2k category to the ≥$22.9k category. Finally, there were five towns that fell in the ≥$22.9k category. What makes up the top NCEP with over $22.9k is an interesting set of towns. These five towns are Hartford, Bloomfield, East Windsor, Windsor Locks, and East Granby, all five of which have very different demographics. East Windsor and Windsor Locks have an almost even split of White and BIPOC students, whereas East Granby has almost 75% White students. Hartford and Bloomfield swing in the other direction as both have over 90% BIPOC students.</p>

          <h2>Percent BIPOC and Net Current Expenditures per Pupil</h2>
          <p>After compiling the data, we found that there is in fact a correlation with the percent of BIPOC students and per student spending. We determined that on average the towns with a higher percent of BIPOC students will have a higher amount of funding. This data has a correlation coefficient of 0.2722244485. Although this is a positive correlation between the variables, the closer to zero, the weaker the correlation. Because of this, there is a correlation between the funding of each school district and Percent BIPOC students, however, the relationship is not significantly strong. The scatterchart visualize these relationships with a linear best fit line.</p>
